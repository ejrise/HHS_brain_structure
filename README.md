# Hormone Health Study (HHS)

The Hormone Health Study (HHS) at the University of California, Santa Barbara was designed to probe an understudied question relevant to half of the world's population: how does the menstrual cycle impact the human nervous system?
To uncover answers, we applied state-of-the-art neuroimaging and physiological recording techniques to assess how human physiology, behavior, and brain structure and function co-fluctuate with naturally cycling hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)-axis hormones across 3 estimated cycle phases: menses, ovulation, and mid-luteal. 

### Dataset: Brain Anatomy and Structure 
**Current Version:** 1.0.0 

**Note:** This repository contains code for preprocessing and analyzing HHS brain structural data, as published in [Rizor et al., 2024, Human Brain Mapping](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26785). Future updates may include code for functional resting-state measures. [The MRI data repository for the study can be found here](doi:10.18112/openneuro.ds005360.v1.0.0).
